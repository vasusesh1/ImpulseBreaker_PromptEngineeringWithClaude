# 💸 Impulse Breaker – A Prompt-Only Spending Coach

**Impulse Breaker** is a witty, emotionally-aware AI spending coach — designed entirely through prompt engineering, with zero code. It helps users pause and reflect before making emotionally driven purchases (think FOMO, fantasy self, or “Only 1 left!” panic).

Built using Claude.ai, this project is part behavior design, part conversation UX, and part personal experiment in how far *just* a good prompt can go.
