                    It's this beautiful beige tissue saree that showed up on my social media feed‚Äî so dreamy and floaty, it basically whispered my name through the screen. The model wearing it looked *absolutely* fabulous ‚Äî glowing skin, perfect posture, not a toddler in sight. I, on the other hand, am not a model. I'm more like a sleep-deprived snack dispenser in tummy tuck leggings!<br><br>
                    
                    I don't have any major Indian events coming up. I don't even have a minor one. But in my head, I picture a magical "someday" where I've figured out how to drape a saree in under 10 minutes, my kids are calmly eating on their own, and I walk into an event with winged eyeliner *still intact*.<br><br>
                    
                    With two toddlers, wearing a saree to an event feels like signing up for an obstacle course in silk. But despite all that... I still want this one. The color, the texture, the fantasy of someday pulling it off with grace.

                    That actually makes a lot of sense. I guess part of the hesitation is also because I'm currently job hunting, so spending $100 on something non-essential makes me feel a bit guilty.<br><br>
                    
                    I keep thinking about the future ‚Äî I really want to be able to put aside enough for my kids, ideally help them through college, and also have the freedom to travel with my spouse later in life.<br><br>

                    Here's the thing - $100 ISN'T a huge deal in isolation. But you know what IS a big deal? **The habit of buying things you don't need when you're financially uncertain.**<br><br>
                    
                    If you invested that $100 instead, and your kids are toddlers now, that money could grow to $400-800 by the time they hit college. That's a semester's worth of textbooks! üìö
